This repository contains an Unity example project about a real-time covering reality function with real-time shadows by using AR Plane Manager with an AR Default Plane with a material including a special shader names FeatheredPlaneShadow.shader which I made changes on the offical FeatherPlaneShader.shader.

In addition, the version 4.0.0 of both ARFoundation and ARKit are using in this project for achieving the effect of human occlusion which is only included in such version.
